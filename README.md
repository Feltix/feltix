A Fountain/Wrap export tool, with some extras...

## Overview
Wrap is an open source command line tool that is able to convert Fountain and
Wrap files into a correctly formatted screen- or stageplay as an HTML or a PDF.

Fountain is an awesome format to write screenplays in English, Wrap builds upon
this to add support for different languages and stageplays whilst still fully
supporting normal Fountain files.

All this in a FOSS package that you can use straight from the commandline.
